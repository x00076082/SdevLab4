When an admin person logs in and wishes to update a product's category,
they first click on the update icon for the product whose category they 
wish to update. This calls the updateProduct method in the AdminController.
This then creates a form based on the product clicked and fills it with
this products details. When the category edit is made, the admin clicks
save. This calls the addProduct method and also makes sure the user is an
admin to make this change. As the product has already been created, it 
will call the update method
